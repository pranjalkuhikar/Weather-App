🌩️ Boss: "We can't afford the pay rise he wants."
HR Manager: "Then we should pay for it."
 
"What?! Why?" asked Boss.
 
HR Manager replied:
"If we can't afford his increase, we can't afford to advertise, interview, hire, pay, and train his replacement. It costs less to keep staff than replace them."

💡 *Employee retention isn't just a cost-saving measure; it's a strategic investment!

In other news, I've just launched a weather web app using React JS, leveraging OpenWeather API through Axios for seamless data fetching, and styled with the sleek and responsive Material UI. 🌦️
